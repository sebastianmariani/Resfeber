# Resfeber

This repository is a project that I created in order to apply my knowledge on HTML, CSS and JS.  I implemented a log in form that is interactive and that checks instanstly the input once the user submit the form. The [website](https://sebastianmariani.github.io/Resfeber-travel-start-up/) is a sample Travel Start Up that allow you to plan your next journey by taking inspirations and tips from other users experiences, hold all your memories and keep track of your adventures all in one place.
## Instruction
To view the log in form just click on the [sign in](https://sebastianmariani.github.io/Resfeber-travel-start-up/passwordValidation/passwordValidation.html) at the landing page, that would take you to the html file with the form.
